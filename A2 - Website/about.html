      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>Open Science Network Society is a British Columbia incorporated nonprofit society dedicated to promoting open citizen science through providing a community-supported biology laboratory that is safe, accessible, inclusive and affordable. We believe reducing barriers in science through collaboration is important. By sharing knowledge and equipment, we enable citizen scientists, hobbyists, artists, students and entrepreneurs to work on personal projects, collaborate and learn new skills.</p><br>
      <h2>We are Membership Supported</h2>
      <p>Open Science Network was founded by a group of science enthusiasts who come from different walks of life – artists, engineers, computer scientists and biologists. Members help us pay our bills, if you show up for more then a few nights we would suggest that you become an OSN member and help support us. Come to our biolab – Vancouver’s first community biolab – during Open Lab Wednesday where are are open to the public and learn all about us.</p><br>
      <h2>Adult Education and Outreach</h2>
      <p>We agree with our colleagues at Genspace that the best way to inform the dialogue about 21st century science is to have the stakeholders understand it from a hands-on perspective. To that end, we offer an immersive in-lab experience to people with no prior lab training along with programs including a Speaker’s Series and Journal Clubs. On top of that, we run a STEM Mentoring Cafe, providing opportunity for youth to get involved.</p><br>
